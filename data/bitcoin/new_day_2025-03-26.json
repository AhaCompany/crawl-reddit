Take the difference between someone born in some more religious Middle Eastern countries, versus those of Scandinavia, where we can see a new shift in secularity in younger generations.\n\n# A Not Very Tasteful Comparison\n\nI mention this oversimplification, because I want to extend these attributes towards another 'deeply ingrained shared belief system' -¬†**currency**. An economic system that we were born into, have believed in from a young age. One where some where born under the U.S. Dollar, and others, under the Venezuelan Bolivar.\n\nIts commonly said that the fiat currencies we have today, unbacked by precious metals, only hold value because¬†**we all believe**¬†in their value. Irregardless of evidence to back that value, and propped up solely due to our common belief. Of course, that's really what value is though,¬†*right*? We can accept $20 from someone because our belief in the value of that $20, and our extended belief that when we eventually want to spend it, the recipient will also believe in that value as well. Extrapolate that throughout an entire nation, and you have the shared belief system that allows the economy to function.\n\nSome nations, like the religion comparison between the Middle East and Scandinavia, also happen to have their economic belief systems also in different camps. Take the beliefs of those in the United States, which have a (relatively) very strong belief in their currency, to that of Venezuela or Lebanon, whose economic beliefs are on a little shakier of a ground.\n\nSome individuals are much more prone to look for alternatives, and this is why we can see a higher adoption of Bitcoin in these countries with economically shakier foundations. Just like we might consider those more prone to look for alternatives in religion when their current belief system is not providing them with the right answers.\n\nGetting someone to un-learn their economic belief system, one that they have grown up with their entire life, that their family and community uses, and learn about why Bitcoin is a better alternative, is almost akin to trying to convert them from Religion A to Religion B.\n\n# An Somehow Even Less Tasteful Comparison\n\nImagine, A well dressed man rides up to your house on a bicycle. He knocks on your door and proceeds to try to convince you that the dollars you have spent your life earning, spending, and believing in, are broken. How? Your parents used dollars, their parents used dollars, and even their parents may have used dollars. You get paid in dollars, you purchase food in dollars,¬†**everyone you know and love**¬†**uses dollars for everything**. Sure you have questioned those beliefs sometimes when the bank charged you that crazy fee one time, or when that one restaurant wouldn't accept cash, or even last week when the grocery store decided they wanted to charge way more for eggs.¬†**But that wasn't the dollars problem, that was something else, surely?**\n\nWho does this man think he is, to get you to believe in this currency whose creator we have no proof exists? To switch to a currency that is intangible. How can is be real if you can not hold it?\n\n# The Unfortunate Church of Bitcoin\n\nUnfortunately, this is the state we find ourselves in sometimes. An incredibly difficult 'sell'. To get someone to actually understand Bitcoin, they of course have to¬†**want**¬†to understand Bitcoin, as true with almost anything.\n\nThose that have the easiest time understanding it, are those that can more easily see the flaws in their own economic systems. As I mentioned in a previous post:\n\n>\n\nIt's not a good look though, of course. People rightfully can sense when something is a little-too-preachy. And by it's nature, Bitcoin can seem right up that alley due to the things I've mentioned above.¬†**Especially**¬†to someone born in a very privileged economic system.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis concludes our sermon. The money basket is being passed around now, please be generous. After all, our tax-exempt status hasn't been approved yet.",
