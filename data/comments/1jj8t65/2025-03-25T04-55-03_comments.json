    "body": "Dude. Don’t apologize. It’s not exactly straight forward - you’re doing proper research. Good on ya! \n\nSome suggest splitting your stash, if respectively big enough, between two cold storages (so two seed phrases). Some devices offer back up or recovery solutions. Keep looking into it so you feel good about the process. \n\nThe simple steps: have unquestionable certainty your seed phrase is correct and written down before continuing on the process, and then never lose that seed phrase or house it electronically anywhere ever. Then you’re pretty good to go! If you lose the device or it’s broken, your seed phrase can be recovered. \n\nBe sure to go with an open source device like a Trezor though there are newer fancier ones out there now.",

    "body": "The odds of both devices dying at the same time are much, much less than the odds of a single device dying. Once one device dies, you would need to immediately create a new backup of the remaining device so that you once again have 2 good copies.\n\nIt is possible, however, that both devices could die simultaneously. Especially if they are stored together and both are destroyed by the same event (fire, tornado, flood, etc).  Therefore, if you want to increase the chances that your access to your crypto is not lost, then you may want to consider two or more copies of a seed phrase on damage resistant materials securely stored separate from each other.",
