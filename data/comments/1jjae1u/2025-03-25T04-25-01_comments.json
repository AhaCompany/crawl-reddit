A significant improvement over pasting the unmodified code into the browser console. I might also suggest uploading to somewhere like GreasyFork, it has Github sync so you don't have to juggle changes between the places. That's actively moderated, so scripts there are well-trusted and would mean people typically have no qualms installing the script.",
