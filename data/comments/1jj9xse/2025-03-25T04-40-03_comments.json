I had a borderline addiction to pvp games and was struggling to get rid of them, or find any other games that interested me. I picked up outer wilds on a whim and man was it worth it!! It was awesome to get so hooked on a game that had none of the fast paced, dopamine inducing action i was looking to get away from. Amazing game, and will forever hold a special place in my heart as something i experienced on the start of my journey to make gaming a healthy hobby for myself again.",
