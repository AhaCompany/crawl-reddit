    "body": "You do that! UTXO is created every time you deposit into cold storage. The sum of all UTXOs is your total wallet balance. Each UTXO incurrs a tx fee. This is why ppl minimise send count, and periodically consolidate when timechain congestion is low and tx fees are low.\n\nRe. Broker, with BTC it's legally an IOU and depending on the capital structure of coinbase you're entitled to a % of liquidation in case of chapter 11, but not guaranteed all your BTC back. Not your keys, not your cheese.",
