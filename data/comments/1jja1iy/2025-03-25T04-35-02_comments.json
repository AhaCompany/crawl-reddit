I might be annoying to some but I like to inform people I like that are unaware of the current opportunity they have. 95% donâ€™t give it much thought but Iâ€™ve got 3 people so far to do some research and get some sats, and I never would have become good friends with another coworker that was already stacking like crazy if I didnâ€™t bring it up first. Iâ€™ve only ran into 2 buttcoiners and I was quickly able to tell neither one of them have spent more than 5 mins actually learning about it lol.",
