I don't mind spending a bit here and there(not worse than gambling at the casino or spending on dumb shit at the mall imo) but it seemed over the top in that aspect so your comment kinda sealed the deal for me in regard of playing genshin. \n\nIn between WuWa and ZZZ I prefer the looks/designs of ZZZ but the fact that it's also mihoyo feels like a bad sign. But then again I'm new to gatcha so maybe I'm overreacting.",
