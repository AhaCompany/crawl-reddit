    "body": "I'd say go with WuWa. It's been making a lot of correct decisions and listening to players feedback the most. The last area was much better than the first 2 and it's anniversary will be coming soon, the update is in 3 days and after that it'll have the steam release so there will be a lot of freebies for sure.\n\nI haven't tried zzz but seems fun although it does seem targeted at a younger audience.\n\nGenshin has 5 years of content you can play through at your own pace but events and characters will make you want to rush everything and A LOT of hype, lore, and cohesiveness came from being in the right place at the right time with events. The vibes and aesthetic are top notch tho.",

    "body": "Thanks for the thorough reply. To be honest WuWa seemed the best at first glance too so I'll keep your opinion in mind. A lot of gatcha games are getting big update which is why I thought it would be a good time to try one! I tried genshin once and it felt overwhelming a little bit with all the content (which is another reason I'm asking for opinion before I give one a good try).",

    "body": "Wuwa has a combat oriented gameplay, quick paced and fluid. We are in the second continent right now and it has been really fun imo. It just keeps improving.\n\nGenshin could be a great gacha game IF you really want to take it slow and ignore events and banners and fomo inducing in general. We are finishing the 6th continent and they made the crazy decision to link character materials to their respective area so if you like new characters you will need to rush a lot of stuff. But if you really like the aesthetics of the game, it is possible to enjoy it. It's just a bit strict in that sense.",

    "body": "If you like parrying and dodging combat that can be intense, withering and zzz both have that. Zzz has no adventure, it's mostly just arena fights. Wuthering and genshin have different vibes, but you could consider them analogous except that genshin has a lot more content because it's older. If you wanna start any of them, I suggest going to their subreddits to see if they have an FAQ for new players. These games can be overwhelming when you start and the FAQs will tell you what you can ignore. (In all three of these games, you can ignore all of the stat building and some of the items/currencies until late game) all three can be enjoyed a lot as free to play, but I feel like zzz is the most generous with rewards and such. Wuthering is next and genshin is the least generous",
