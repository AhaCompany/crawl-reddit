Why sell for a house when you can take out a mortgage at a lower interest rate than BTC typically appreciates at?

Meanwhile pretty soon after I sold at pretty close to the local top for some time, Bitcoin depreciated drastically. I ended up flipping the car for a profit, buying a better car and then over the course of 2022 and 2023 bought back all the BTC I had sold and then some and now have more than ever.
